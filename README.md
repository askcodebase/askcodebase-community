2. Start a conversation with the AI

That's it! You're now ready to explore a completely new way of programming.

## A Paradigm Shift: Conversational Programming

Programming, as we know it, is on the brink of evolution. With AskCodebase, we introduce the Next-Generation Developers' User Interface, a revolutionary tool that completely reimagines the conventional coding way, bringing about an innovative era of **conversational programming.**

AskCodebase transforms your Visual Studio Code into an interactive chat room, a space where you're in an intuitive, ongoing dialogue with your codebase. Engage in seamless conversations with our AI-powered askCodebase assistant to **add functionalities, debug issues, refactor your code, and deploy** with a level of efficiency never experienced before.

## Envision the Future of Coding

AskCodebase is not merely an innovation, but a vision for the future of coding. Our goal is to catalyze a transition from traditional code writing to a more interactive, intuitive paradigm - conversational programming.

Through either traditional commands or natural language instructions, AskCodebase allows developers to guide the AI to write, refactor, and organize the codebase. We aim to augment the existing practice of consulting ChatGPT and pasting code into the IDE, allowing developers to interact more fluidly with the codebase.

Deeply integrated with VSCode, AskCodebase harnesses VSCode's features like Code Symbols, Source code FileTree, and Call Graph via Language Server Protocol for comprehensive understanding and interaction with your codebase.
